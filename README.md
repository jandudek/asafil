This is a Chrome plugin that allows filtering in an Asana board. It's basically a hack which traverses the DOM and displays/hides story cards.

Download into a directory, go to chrome://extensions/ , turn on "Developer mode", then "Load unpacked" and load the directory.

Then open an Asana board and use the extension to filter out columns / cards from the board.
